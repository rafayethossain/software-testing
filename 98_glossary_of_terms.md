# Glossary of Terms

__9's__: See __n nines__.

__Acceptance testing__: Testing by an end user, customer, or other independent personnel to verify that the system can be accepted for use.

__Accessibility error__: An error resulting from a user employing a non-standard input or output device, where the system is not usable for those who do not access the system using "standard" devices.

__Active attack__: In __security testing__, an attack on a system which causes some changes to the system, such as adding a program or modifying data in a database.

__Ad hoc testing__: A (sometimes considered pejorative) term for __exploratory testing__.

__All-pairs testing__: Another term for __pairwise testing__.

__Alpha testing__: "Real-world" testing by a small group of test engineers or some other small group of technically proficient personnel.  Often succeeded by beta testing.

__Application under test__: The system which the tester is testing.

__Assertion__: In a unit test, a statement which states that a certain condition must hold.  If the condition does not hold, the test is considered to have failed.  For example, `assertEquals(2, Math.sqrt(4));`.

__Availability__: In __performance testing__, what percentage of the time the system is available to the user (not in a failure mode, unresponsive, etc.)  In __security testing__, one of the elements of the __InfoSec Triad__, an attribute that refers to the ability of authorized users to access a system.

__Bacteria__: A kind of __malware__ which consumes an excess amount of system resources, perhaps taking up all file descriptors or disk space.

__Bad data error__: An error resulting from the system receiving malformed, corrupt, or otherwise invalid data.

__Base case__: A test case for the basic expected functionality of a system, or an interior value in an equivalence class.  For example, when testing a calculator, a base case might be a user adding 2 and 2 together.

__Baseline test__: A kind of __load test__ where a bare minimum amount of events, perhaps even none, are processed, to provide a "baseline" to show what minimal load on the system looks like.

__Bathtub curve__: A generalized function of failure rates, which start out high (as poor components fail soon after being implemented), stay low throughout much of the life of the system, then start increasing as the system nears it end of life.  So named because it looks like the outline of a bathtub as viewed from the side.

__Beta testing__: "Real-world" testing by a subset of the actual user base prior to release of the system.  Often preceded by alpha testing.

__Binomial coefficient__: The number of __r-combinations__ of a given __set__ of size _n_.  It is determined by the formula `C(n, r) = n! / (r! * (n - r)!)`.

__Black-box testing__: Testing the code as a user would, with no knowledge of the codebase.  Most manual tests are black-box tests.

__Blocked__: A status for a test case in a test run.  It indicates that the test case cannot be executed at this time, for reasons outside the tester's control.  For example, the functionality it tests is not yet at a testable state, perhaps because it has not yet been developed.

__Blocker__: A defect of the highest severity, where the system cannot reasonably be released without fixing it or providing a __workaround__.

__Bot network__: A collection of __zombies__ controlled by a master.

__Boundary value__: A value which is "on the boundary" between equivalence classes.  For example, a system that has two equivalence classes, between 0 and 19, and 20 or higher, would have boundary values at 19 and 20.

__Bounds checking__: Run-time checking that data is not being written outside of a properly allocated array.

__Branch coverage__: What percentage of branches in the code are tested, usually by unit tests.

__Brownfield development__: Writing software which must interact with already-existing software in production, thus limiting potential design, solutions, architecture, etc.

__Denial of Service__: A method of attacking __availability__ by sending so many unauthorized packets or other events to a computing resource that no authorized users have access to it.

__Dependency injection__: Passing dependencies of a method in as parameters, as opposed to having them be hard-coded.  This helps with testing as they can easily be replaced with test doubles or fakes.

__Deterministic__: Something for which the causal behaviors are entirely known and reproducible.

__Disk I/O Error__: An error resulting from a fault in reading or writing to long-term local storage (usually, but not always, a disk).

__Display error__: An error where the correct value was computed, but it was not displayed correctly.

__Distributed Denial of Service__: A __denial of service__ attack which consists of many different sources of the unauthorized packets, so as to increase the number of events the system must process as well as help disguise the ultimate source.  Often abbreviated as __DDos__.

__Dynamic testing__: Testing the system by executing it.  Examples would be unit testing or black-box testing.

__Edge case__: A test case for functionality of a system which can be expected to happen, but will be rare and may require special work to handle appropriately from a development point of view.  For example, when testing a calculator, an edge case might be ensuring that trying to divide by zero provides a correct error message.

__Error of assumption__: An error resulting from a developer or other person making an incorrect assumption about how the system should work.

__Evil monkey__: A __stochastic testing__ method whereby malicious code or data is sent in to a system.  Simulates an attacker trying to gain access or cause damage to a system.

__Execution steps__: The actual steps that the test will execute after ensuring that all preconditions hold.

__Exhaustive testing__: Testing every single possibility of input, environment, and other relevant factors for a given system under test.  For example, if testing a `int max(int a, int b)` Java method which returns the greater of the two values `a` and `b`, ensuring that it worked for every single combination of values a (MININT..MAXINT) and b (MININT..MAXINT), or 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 test cases.  Exhaustive testing is often not feasible in practice.

__expect__: A program which allows you to automate interactions with command-line programs.

__Expected behavior__: What the system is expected to do under certain circumstances.  For example, after typing in "`2 + 2 =`" on a calculator, the expected behavior is that the system will display "`4`" on the screen.

__Explicit boundary value__: A __boundary value__ explicitly called out by the system requirements.  For example, requirements for an automated thermometer may state the system will turn on the DANGER light when the registered temperature is 102 degrees or over.  The explicit boundary values would be 101 and 102. Contrast with __implicit boundary value__.

__Exploit__: A program or piece of data which takes advantage of a vulnerability.  A vulnerability is "strictly theoretical" until somebody develops a way to exploit it.

__Exploratory testing__: An informal style of testing, where the goal is often both to learn about the system by testing it as well as find defects.

__External quality__: The quality of the system from a user's perspective - that is, does it meet the requirements, perform as expected, produce correct results, etc.

__Externally consistent (requirements)__: The property of having the system be consistent with requirements of other systems or of the universe.  For example, having a system which mandates that the system will be able to communicate with a base on Pluto instantaneously would require faster-than-light communication, and would thus be inconsistent with the laws of this universe.

__Fabrication__:  In __security testing__, an attack on __integrity__, which deliberately adds data, such as an attack which allows a user to create an entirely new bank account.

__Factorial__: A mathematical function which calculates the result of an integer n multipled by n - 1, n - 2, etc. all the way until 1.  For example, 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1, or 120.

__Failed__: A status for a test case in a test run.  It indicates that, while the test itself was executed without error, the system has not met at least one postcondition or expected output value, or some other unexpected behavior has taken place.  In other words, the observed behavior was not the expected behavior.

__Failure case__: A kind of test where the expected behavior of the system is to fail in a certain way.  For example, sending in a negative number to a square root function which does not support imaginary numbers may be expected to throw an exception. Compare to __success case__.

__Fake__: A kind of __test double__ in which the behavior of the double is handled by the object itself, as opposed to being referenced by stub methods.  These act as simpler, faster versions of the actual object, in order to make tests run faster or reduce dependencies.

__Falsifying the invariant__: Showing an example where an __invariant__ does not hold, such as an invariant for arithmetic method that adding two positive integers should always result in a number greater than one of the numbers, and showing that 1 + 1 = 0.

__Feasible__: In regard to requirements, possible to test with a realistic timeframe and allocation of resources.

__Field testing__: Testing that a system works while actually operating with real users.

__Hacker__: According to the Jargon File, "[a] person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems and how to stretch their capabilities".  Often used in modern times to mean the same as __cracker__.

__Happy path__: The easiest path a user will take through the system, when the system is operating properly, without attempting to perform anything that is an __edge case__ or __corner case__.

__IDE__: Integrated Development Environment.  A single tool which unifies much of the functionality allowing a developer to write, such as running tests, compiling, and configuring dependencies.

__Idempotent__: A quality of a function or request where the same result will be returned no matter how many times it is called.  For example, multiplying a number by one is an idemepotent operation (5 * 1 = 5, 5 * 1 * 1 = 5, 5 * 1 * 1 * 1 = 5, etc.), but adding one two a number is a __non-idempotent__ operation (5 + 1 = 6, 5 + 1 + 1 = 7, 5 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8, etc.).

__Identifier__: A number or string which uniquely identifies a test case, defect, or anything else.

__-ility requirement__: Another term for __non-functional requirement__, so named because many of these requirements use words ending in "-ility" to describe them (e.g., usability, scalability, maintainability).

__Impact__: When reporting defects, how the defect will affect users of the system.

__Implicit boundary value__: A __boundary value__ that is not explicitly called out by the system requirements, but may have an impact on the system's operation.  For example, code written using 32-bit signed integers (such as `int` in Java) has an implicit boundary at 2,147,483,647, the maximum integer size.  Adding one to this will cause the number to overflow.

__Impure__: The opposite of __pure__, a method or function which produces at least one __side effect__.

__Injection error__: An error where the system accidentally allows arbitrary code to be executed.  Leaves the system vulnerable to an __injection attack__.

__Input value__: A particular value which will be passed in to a test case.

__Internal quality__: The quality of the codebase as seen from the developers' perspective - that is, is the code readable, understandable, maintainable, extensible, etc.

__Internally consistent (requirements)__: The property of having no requirements contradict each other.  For example, a requirements specification which has a requirement which states "The system shall always leave the red light on" and another requirement which states that "The system shall turn off the red light if `SWITCH1` is enabled" would not be internally consistent.

__Interruption__: In __security testing__, an attack on __availability__, such as a __DDoS attack__ or pulling the plug from a network switch.

__Invariant__: In __property-based testing__, a property that should always hold for a function or method.  For example, a sorting method which accepts an unsorted array should always return an array with the same number of elements as the unsorted original.

Contrast with __functional requirement__.

__Non-idempotent__: A quality of a function or request where the same result may or may not be returned, depending on how many times that function is called.  For example, multiplying a number by one is an __idempotent__ operation (5 * 1 = 5, 5 * 1 * 1 = 5, 5 * 1 * 1 * 1 = 5, etc.), but adding one two a number is a non-idempotent operation (5 + 1 = 6, 5 + 1 + 1 = 7, 5 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8, etc.)

__Normal__: A defect of a severity which is noticeable but does not strongly hamper the user's use of the system.

__Null pointer error__: An error resulting from the code trying to dereference a null pointer, or access a null object.

__Observed behavior__: What the system actually does under certain circumstances.  For example, if I type in "`2 + 2 =`" on a calculator, the __expected behavior__ may be that I see "`4`", but if I instead see "`WALLA WALLA`", then "`WALLA WALLA`" is the observed behavior.

__Off-by-one error__: A specific kind of __logic error__ where a program does something wrong because a value is off by one unit.

__Operational testing__: Testing that a system works under real-world conditions.

__Output value__: A particular value which will be output by a test case.  The distinction between these and postconditions in manual or other black-box testing can be hazy; in white-box testing, values that are directly returned from a method are output values.

__Packet analyzer__: A tool which allows you to view individual packets that are being transmitted over the network.

__Packet sniffing__: Using a __packet analyzer__ or similar software to view data being transmitted over a network.

__Pair programming__: Two people working at the same time on a problem on a single computer.  Can be a white-box tester and developer, looking at the code together.

__Phreaker__: Another term for __phone phreak__.

__Pinning test__: An automated test (usually a unit test) which checks for the current response of a system, in order to modify code without modifying existing behavior.  Note that pinning tests check for the current response, _not_ the correct response.  Often used when refactoring or adding to __legacy code__.

__Positive test case__: See __success case__.

__Postcondition__: All conditions which need to hold true after the execution steps in order for the test to pass.  For example, a postcondition after editing your user name may be that the Account Information page shows the new user name.

__Precondition__: All conditions which need to hold true before the execution steps of a test case can begin.  For example, when testing the Account Information of a website, a precondition may be that the user is already logged in.

__Principle of Least Privilege__: The principle that states that users should have the minimal amount of access to the system necessary to do their jobs.  For example, a developer should not (in general) have access to payroll data, and HR personnel should not have access to source code.

__Profiler__: A tool which allows you to measure the resource utilization and internal events (such as method calls or instantiation of objects) of a running program.

__Property-based testing__: A method of testing, usually automated, where many values, often pseudorandomly generated, are given as inputs, and properties of the output are tested as opposed to checking for specific values or behavior.

__Pure__: A method or function which does not produce any __side effects__, but simply returns the result of a computation.

__QA__: See __quality assurance__.

__Qualitative__: Not able to be expressed numerically, such as "the system shall be _extremely_ cool".  Contrast with __quantitative__.

__Quality assurance__: Ensuring the quality of software, by a variety of methods.  Software testing is an important, but not the only, part of quality assurance.

__Quality attribute__: Another (probably better) term for __non-functional requirement__.

__Quantitative__: Able to be expressed numerically, such as "the system shall respond within 500 milliseconds".  Contrast with __qualitative__.

__r-combination__: A __subset__ of _r_ elements from a __set__, in which order does not matter.  The value _r_ can be replaced with a specific value, such as 2 or 3, to indicate the number of elements in the subset.  For example, `[2, 3, 1]` is a 3-combination of the set `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, and is equivalent to `[1, 2, 3]`.

__r-permutation__: A __subset__ of _r_ elements from a __set__, in which order matters.  The value _r_ can be replaced with a specific value, such as 2 or 3, to indicate the number of elements in the subset.  For example, `[2, 3, 1]` and `[1, 2, 3]` are two different 3-permutations of the set `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.

__Test artifact__: A document or other byproduct of the testing process, such as test plans or results.

__Test case__: The smallest unit of a test plan, these are the individual tests which describe what is to be tested and a check for the expected behavior of a system.

__Test coverage__: A general term for which aspects or parts of the system are covered by tests.

__Test double__: A "fake object" which can be used in unit testing to limit dependencies on other classes, which may have problems of their own, not yet be developed, or simply be time- or resource-intensive to actually instantiate.

__Test fixture__: A procedure or program which puts a system into a state ready for testing.

__Test hook__: A "hidden" method which allows input to, or output from, the system in order to make it easier to test.

__Test plan__: A list of related test cases that are run together.

__Test run__: An actual iteration (run-through) of a test plan.

__Test runner__: A program which will automatically execute a suite of tests.

__Test suite__: A grouping of related test plans.

__Testability__: A quality of a system that specifies how easy it is to test---having well-designed and coherent methods, pure functions where possible, allowance for dependency injection, etc.

__Testable code__: Code which can be easily tested in an automated fashion at multiple levels of abstraction.

__Test-Driven Development (TDD)__: A particular software development methodology which embraces __test-first development__ along with several other tenets, such as continuous refactoring and expectation of change.

__Test-First Development__: Any software development methodology in which tests are written before the code that makes them pass.

__Test-Unfriendly Construct__: A part of the structure of the code which is difficult to test, such as a constructor, finalizer, or private method.

__Test-Unfriendly Function__: A functional aspect of a program which is difficult to test, such as communicating over a network or writing to disk.

__Threshold__: In __performance testing__, another term for __performance threshold__.

__Throughput__: In __performance testing__, the number of events or tasks the system can handle in a given time frame.

__Total time__: The total amount of time that code (user or kernel) executes, without taking into account other factors (such as time spent waiting for input).  Compare to __real time__.

__Traceability matrix__: A two-dimensional matrix displaying test cases and requirements and indicating which test cases test which requirements.

__Trapdoor__: A program or piece of a program which provides secret access to a system or application.

__Triage__: A meeting or other way (e.g. email discussion) of prioritizing defects.

__Trivial__: A defect of a severity which is not noticeable, or hardly noticeable, and only causes the smallest of issues for a user of the system.

__Trojan horse__: A kind of __malware__ which pretends to be another kind of program in order to trick users into installing and executing it.

__Truth table__: A table which shows all possible values of a group of Boolean (true/false) variables.

__TUC__: See __Test-Unfriendly Construct__.

__TUF__: See __Test-Unfriendly Function__.

__Unambiguous (requirements)__: The property of having requirements which can be read and understood in one and only one way.

__Undefined__: In regards to a system specification, any area where the behavior is not specified.  For example, if my entire system specification is "The first light shall turn on if the input value is less than 4", the behavior for how the system should behave if the input value is 7 is undefined.

__Unit testing__: Testing the smallest individual units of code, such as methods or functions, in a white-box manner.

__Unscripted testing__: Testing without a rigid script, where the tester has broad latitude to use their own volition and knowledge to determine the quality of the system or find defects. Contrast with __scripted testing__.

__User acceptance testing__: A particular kind of __acceptance testing__ where the tester is the user of the software.  It ensures that the system under test is acceptable to the user by meeting their needs.

__User testing__: Having an actual user of the system attempt to perform tasks, often without instruction, in order to determine how users interact with the system.

__User time__: The amount of time that user code executes while a system performs a task.

__Utilization__: In __performance testing__, the relative or absolute amount of a given computing resource (e.g., RAM, processor instructions, disk space) that is used under certain circumstances.

__Validation__: Ensuring that the system meets the needs of the customer.  Checking that you built the right _system_.

__Verification (category of testing)__: Ensuring that the system operates correctly, does not crash, provides correct answers, etc.  Checking that you built the system _right_.

__Verification (in unit testing)__: Checking that a particular method was called on a __mock__ object.

__Virus__: A kind of __malware__, often small, that replicates itself with human intervention.  This intervention could be something such as clicking on a link or running a program sent to you as an attachment.

__Vulnerability__: A potential defect that would allow a user to compromise or otherwise gain unauthorized access to a system.

__Wall clock time__: Another term for __real time__.

__White-box testing__: Testing the code directly and with full knowledge of the code under test.  __Unit testing__ is an example of white-box testing.

__Workaround__: A method for avoiding a known __defect__ while still being able to use the system.

__Worm__: A kind of __malware__, often small, that replicates itself without human intervention.

__YAGNI__: You Ain't Gonna Need It.  A tenet of __Test-Driven Development__ which states that you should not do work or add features which are not immediately necessary.

__Zombie__: A computer with software installed which allows unauthorized users access to it to perform unauthorized functionality.  For example, a system might have a mailer program built in which will allow other users to send spam from your machine, so that the original users cannot be tracked.
