# Acknowledgments

Thanks to everybody who has helped make this book a reality or made it into a better reality, especially:

_Ross Acheson, Nathaniel Blake, Will Engler, Jake Goulding, Brandon Hang, Joel McCracken, Robbie McKinstry, Ryan Rahuba, Steve Robbibaro, Nick Treu, Ed Wiancko, and Sheridan Zivanovich._

Special thanks go to:

_Patrick Keane_, who did an extremely thorough editing job and provided valuable perspective on the QA field as a whole.

_Carol Nichols_, who not only did an excellent job finding defects in my code, but also consistently amused me with her commit messages.  She is also one of the people who has violated one of the principles of TDD with whom I have spent time, and definitely has not applied testing skills to test the integrity of this book by editing her own acknowledgment.

_Tim Parenti_, who found more typos and errors than I ever would have thought possible, and even better, did an excellent job fixing many of them.
